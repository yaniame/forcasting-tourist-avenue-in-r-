# forcasting-tourist-visit-in-r-
## Overview
This project focuses on forecasting the number of tourists visiting an island over a 25-year period using time series analysis. The dataset contains historical records of tourist arrivals, providing valuable insights into visitor trends. Accurate predictions can help local authorities optimize resources and improve infrastructure planning.

## Dataset
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle: Tourist Numbers Univariate Forecasting Dataset
It includes historical tourist arrivals over several years for forecasting purposes.

## Usage
Load the dataset: The notebook includes code to load the dataset from Kaggle. Ensure you have access to Kaggle datasets using kagglehub.

Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, formats dates, and prepares data for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes historical trends and identifies seasonality.

Time Series Forecasting: Applies statistical models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and other machine learning techniques to forecast future tourist arrivals.

Evaluation & Interpretation: Compares models based on forecasting accuracy metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

Results
The notebook explores different forecasting techniques and evaluates their performance to determine the best model for predicting tourist arrivals.
